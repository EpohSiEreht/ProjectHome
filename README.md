ok, here I'm ;)

1) backend - i think it's gonna be *node.js* - because we all well know node.js and I don't like Ruby on Rails and don't think that's modern for now (trending is JS), but I'm pretty open for smth new, like 'HAPI'

2) frontend - for now it could be simple, but will be cool to try smth new, maybe *react*
This is very popular language, very fast, because it's working with virtual DOM, and we all can practice that skills and it will be very useful.
Also it works well with Node as backend and all JS (yeah, I'm big fan of JS)
But I'm open for your ideas ;)

3) for styling just simple for now, maybe *bootstrap* (css only), to make looks better, but not overweight

4) This project is not so rush, because I just got the job and Steven still looking, so we have no deadlines ;)

5) what services do you wanna use?as given(tweeter, reddit, facebook, hacker news, instagramm, weather, local news/cnn/bbc/fox news)

What do you think?
